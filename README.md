Tremedic
============
## Description

10 million people suffer from Parkinson's, and our best objective diagnostic techniques are prohibitively costly. We think a much more cost-effective solution exists, and Tremedic may be the beginning of that.

## Background

[Justin](https://github.com/jusjmkim), [Kenny](https://github.com/kennysong), [Megan](https://github.com/Neurobiologist), and [Jason](https://github.com/jasoncho3) made this app with love at Hack the North Fall 2014.

## Features

- Node’s non blocking I/O to provide real-time analytics
- Socket.io to maintain an open connection between server and client
- Express framework to create the server’s routes
- Mongo database via the Mongoose ORM

## Usage

You need a Myo and the Myo Connect desktop app to take advantage of the full functionality behind our app.
